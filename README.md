Included is the incomplete weight tracking app. I intend to update this when I complete the app.
The requirements of this app was to contain tables for users weight, goal weight, and user information (username and password). If a new user was detected they should have been prompted to create a new account.
This app was supposed to store a goal weight for user that they set and a daily weight that they updated as well as a notification for when they reached their goal weight.
This app was designed to help users of all ages and weights just keep track of their weight and set a goal, simple as that.
This app required a login screen, new user account creation screen, and home screen after logging in displaying weight, goal, and username. 
The design was a simple design for a simple app.
I used my limited previous knowledge and the reading for class to code what I did for this assignment as well as Google.
I debugged my app and checked for errors and made sure the code I completed worked correctly.
The challenge I came across (aside from time) was that my Java knowledge is very little which did not help much.
